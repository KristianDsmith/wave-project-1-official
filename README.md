Testing

I have tested this website using google dev tools and insected each page. Checked for diffrent screen sizes, 1344px, 1200px, 944px, 704px and 544px screens. I ran into problem with navigation bar and the landing page view in the about section at 544px. But managed to fix this by reducing the font size in navigation bar and changing the collum in the about section. The look and feel of website works really well on diffrent browsers and screen sizes. I changed the gallery to work on each screen size so it was visually appealing. also adjusted the padding on pages for each screen size. all lins throughout the website work and help navigate the guest thrugh the site to eventually contact and book. Once the form is filled in they are taken to a thank you page.
